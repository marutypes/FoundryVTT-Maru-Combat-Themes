## Disclaimer

I found all these sounds on [Sounds Resource](https://sounds-resource.com). I don't see a formal license there but they do have a content use section, so I reproduce that here.

## Use of Content

Content on these sites may not be used in any commercial works. These include, but are not limited to, paid games, free games with in-app purchases or advertisements, monetized videos, and other websites displaying advertisements. This also includes anything 100% free being published to an established market place (e.g. Steam, Apple's App Store, or Google Play). Custom work may be used in non-commercial projects as long as the artist is credited, provided there is nothing included with the submission that would prohibit its use, and in commercial works with the artist's permission and proper credit, provided that the subject matter of the custom work is not copyrighted to another entity (e.g. a custom Mario sprite may still have copyright requirements enforced by Nintendo). Some custom submissions may display "no credit required" or similar but many were created long before the potential for videos seen by millions was known so we ask that you credit them regardless.
