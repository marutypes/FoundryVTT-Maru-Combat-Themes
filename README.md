# Maru's Combat Themes
 This module:
- Adds new themes to the combat theme list
- Creates an entirely separate synced combat theme system that supports setting playlists for different combat events as well as using the included themes

I made this for my Fists of The Ruby Phoenix campaign, so the bundled audio is basically all silly fighting game references.

## Usage
To change your theme, select it from the dropdown menu in  Settings -> Maru's Combat Themes. You can also find settings for whether to use the extra sound effect hooks there as well.

## Themes

The following themes are bundled in in addition to the base ones:
* Guilty Gear Strive
* BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle

## Using Playlists
- go to Settings -> Maru's Combat Themes
- set the theme to "custom"
- assign playlists for each audio queue

## Audio sourcing

I got basically all of these sounds from https://www.sounds-resource.com, I make no claim to copyright on any of them.
