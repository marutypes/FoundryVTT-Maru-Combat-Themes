# Maru's Combat Themes
I made this for my Fists of The Ruby Phoenix campaign. The module adds some custom themes to the combat theme dropdown, and also extends the combat theme system to work with end of combat and round start clips.

The bundled audio is basically all silly fighting game references.

## Usage
To change your theme, select it from the dropdown menu in Core Settings -> Combat Theme. You can also find settings for whether to use the extra sound effect hooks under the modules settings.

## Themes

The following themes are bundled in:
* Guilty Gear Strive
* BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle

### Adding a theme

## Audio sourcing

I got basically all of these sounds from https://www.sounds-resource.com, I make no claim to copyright on any of them.
